# Bank_Teller_Simulation
An implementation of a bank-teller system using discrete simulation to simulate a bank consisting of 4 tellers that service a series of customers. Each customer arrives to the bank and goes to the queue that is the shortest. Arrival of customers is decided by generating pseudo-random numbers. The percentage of time spent at each teller is recorded and outputted.
